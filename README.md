Generic App Testing is a client-side JavaScript library that uses the excellent OPA (One Page Acceptance) and Gherkin support already provided by OpenUI5 to allow UI5 app developers to write entire test scenarios in English language - without coding!

For example for the sentence:
`I click on btnCount 3 times`

Working Sample from openui5-generic-app-testing


#TO RUN
`serve -s -p 8080`
